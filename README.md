# Photo Puzzle Game
A simple game where the player is given a set shuffled pieces of a photo, and a blank template to drag and drop the puzzle pieces onto. The player wins when all pieces are dropped at their respective correct slot. 
## Decisions and assumptions
When starting the project, i made a quick mockup of the web app in order to have an basic design to start from and eventually extend. The application would be developed in the following steps:

*Writing the basic structure of the application through HTML
*Styling the static structure trough CSS
*Writing the code for the dynamic functionality e.g. puzzle pieces and  internal game logic

A navigation bar would help with keeping the difficulty selector, the time as well as other future functionality (e.g. scoreboard or load images). For implementing the rack with starting puzzle pieces, i assumed a container full of smaller squared placeholders where each one contains a puzzle piece. The template was also implemented similarly, with placeholders in which the player can drop pieces onto. 

## Future steps
Some steps that could be taken to make the application better

*An actual difficulty, currently only "easy" is working how
*Better responsive design and mobile compatibility
*An scoreboard based on time and difficulty
